# Build the project if necessary (depends on if the agent needs compiled TS or uses tsx directly)
# For this setup, we will use tsx to run the script directly, so no build step for the agent script itself is strictly needed
# provided we have tsx installed or in dependencies. 
# However, if your project is a SvelteKit app, we might check if we need to build anything shared.
# For the agent script specifically, we just need the source files.
