# Welcome to root0

We are building a world where connection is seamless. No downloads, no walled gardens. Just you, your avatar, and the open web.

## Why the Web?

Because the web is the most accessible platform in human history. By building on standard web technologies like WebGL and WebSockets, we ensure that root0 is available to everyone, everywhere.

## What's Next?

- **Multiplayer**: Connect with friends in real-time. (In Progress)
- **Customization**: Design your own avatar.
- **Spaces**: Build your own corner of the metaverse.

Stay tuned for more updates!
